--- NSE Vulnerability Scan Results ---

NSE Script Detected Vulnerabilities:
|   VULNERABLE:
|     State: LIKELY VULNERABLE

--- Analyzing Service Versions with NVD Integration ---

[!!] VULNERABILITY DETECTED: OpenSSH 6.6 is running, checking NVD for known vulnerabilities.
  [Note] Additional services found but limiting NVD queries to avoid rate limiting during testing.
[!!] VULNERABILITY DETECTED: Apache 2.4.7 is running, checking NVD for known vulnerabilities.
  [Note] Additional services found but limiting NVD queries to avoid rate limiting during testing.

==========================================
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR REMEDIATION
==========================================

Immediate Actions Required (High Priority):
  1. Address all CVEs identified by NVD API queries immediately
  2. Update Apache web server to the latest stable version
  3. Change default database credentials immediately
  4. Implement strong password policies for all services
  5. Address any NSE-detected vulnerabilities immediately

Short-term Improvements (Medium Priority):
  6. Configure SSH to use only strong encryption ciphers
  7. Disable server version disclosure in HTTP headers
  8. Implement proper firewall rules to restrict access
  9. Update all services to their latest secure versions
  10. Monitor NVD regularly for new vulnerabilities affecting your services

Long-term Security Enhancements:
  11. Establish regular vulnerability scanning schedule with NVD integration
  12. Implement intrusion detection system (IDS)
  13. Set up log monitoring and alerting
  14. Conduct regular security awareness training
  15. Implement automated vulnerability management system
